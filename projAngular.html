      <h1>Setting Up Angular in Docker</h1>
      <hr>
      <p> <strong> Date</strong> Winter 2022<p>
      <p> <strong> Project Tools:</strong> Docker, Angular, and Microsoft Word <p>
      <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong>
         During my Instruction Writing class I choose to
          create a manual for how to set up an Angular
          environment in Docker. This project involved
          learning how to set up this environment,
          write the instructions and test them with
           users of different experience levels.
            The process for understanding the set up
            process my self was very involved but creating everything
          into one document that was easy to use was so worth it!

      <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
         <p> <strong> Object of study</strong> Docker </p>
         <p> The item itself is a software called Docker that is used for development.
            To use the software multiple conditions must be met, including
            having a functional computer with the other necessary elements
            like Angular to run and host a website. (These must be updated)
             Additionally for operational specifications, the object needs
              internet connection and a functional web browser. For manufacturing
               purposes, the hardware and equipment must be up to handle the newest
               version of the software, meaning the object must be on a recent/new version of Windows. </p>
      <p> <strong>Audience</strong></p>
      <p>The manual was designed for those that have programming and software
          experience but do not have Angular or Docker on their device.
          (For example, the glossary does not contain what coding is but
           would need to explain terms like nginx and Docker). The audience
         needs to have certain “prerequisites met” like the manual lists in the introduction.</p>
      <h2>Research Methods</h2>
      <p>For my research methods on the manual,
         I completed task analysis with three users at different
         experience levels. Working with each of them
         helped me gather research for the audience analysis as well.
          They completed all sorts of different tasks
       including installing, set-up and use. </p>

         <h2>After the Project</h2>
         <p>This project helped focus on a task that was difficult
            and really create something that was professional but
             also useful. Instruction writing is slowly become one
             of my favorite types of writing.
            And this manual is something I use and reference now for other projects. </p>
