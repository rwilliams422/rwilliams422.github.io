      <h1>Writing and Editing a Children's Book</h1>
      <hr>
      <p> <strong> Date</strong> March 2020 - Current<p>
      <p> <strong> Project Tools:</strong> Adobe Photoshop, Canva, Indesign <p>
      <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong>
         At the beginning of the pandemic,
         I began and a project for writing and publishing a children’s book.
          While the publishing portion is still under production,
          the book itself is done. This project took attention to detail
           and editing skills to get the images and text correct.
           I wrote the story and commissioned my sister to paint the story I had written.
         <p>
            <p>The book, One Big Crazy Family tells the story of my family as we grew
                larger and larger throughout my childhood. If you’ve ever wondered
                what being a part of a big
               family is like or if you’re apart of a big family this book is for you. </p>
