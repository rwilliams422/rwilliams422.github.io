            <h2>Students should be encouraged to write at a collegiate level</h2>

               <div class="article">
                  <p>SVSU students should be encouraged to compose written works at a collegiate level,
                     rather than utilize diction understood by less educated individuals.</p>
                  <p>We should not “dumb down” our communicating,
                     but rather use our language to elevate our understanding</p>
                  <p>As a society, we push students from kindergarten until they graduate college
                      too learn to read better but we are not as persistent when it comes to writing.</p>
                  <p>During my time at SVSU my professors have always encouraged me to write to the reading level of the user,
                          professor or person reading the work I was writing.</p>
                  <p>This seems self-explanatory.</p>
                  <p>If you are writing to a professor,
                     you can use more wordy language than those who are in high school,
                      or young kids.</p>
                  <p>By setting this as the standard, we have created a
                      disconnect where students are never reading things above their reading level.</p>
                  <p>For me, when I read an article that uses words I don’t know,
                      I look them up and learn how to use the word in context.</p>
                  <p>When we encourage students to dumb down their writing, we discourage learning.</p>
                  <p>There are times when it might be appropriate to write using simple language,
                     like when you are writing a text message.</p>
                  <p>However, academic writing is different.
                     The goal is to grow and build your creative mind.</p>
                  <p>Yet we still “dumb down” to lower reading levels in many academic settings.</p>
                  <p>We have set the bar so low as a society that the average person has a seventh grade reading level
                     (and most professors now are saying that has dropped to a fifth grade reading level).</p>
                  <p>As a university, I believe it is our call to set the bar higher than the
                        average reading level, rather than at that average level.</p>
                  <p>I’m not saying we should write third grade textbooks
                      to a high school reading level.</p>
                  <p>Rather, we should write at a college level to college kids,
                      instead of expecting them to have such a low reading level.</p>
                  <p>By doing this we push them to learn new words and understand the
                         documents they are studying.</p>
                  <p>My professor for Advanced Rhetorical Theory
                     expects us to read Plato and understand Plato’s works.</p>
                  <p>It is considered an advanced reading level material, but that
                     does not negate its importance for understanding.</p>
                  <p>There are times where I don’t understand the readings and times where I do.</p>
                  <p>If I don’t understand, I look it up and break it
                     down into smaller pieces and read summaries.</p>
                  <p>Right now, Wordle is the game everyone is playing.</p>
                  <p>You must use your word puzzle skills and think outside the box.</p>
                  <p>This game illustrates that people are hungry to learn and grow their vocabulary.</p>
                  <p>My Facebook feed is full of friends posting their scores in the morning
                     and the comments back and forth about how everyone did.</p>
                  <p>I am a big proponent of word games. One of my current favorites
                      is called, “A Little Wordy.”</p>
                  <p>It’s a new two-player board game by the same people who made the popular
                         “Exploding Kittens” game and inspires creative word writing.</p>
                  <p>Choosing to “write down” and not push towards something better only
                            encourages the reading level of our society to drop lower and lower.</p>
                  <p>I had a professor tell me once that I must assume everyone
                      cannot read or understand what I write.</p>
                  <p>This can be a true assumption.</p>
                  <p>However, am I also supposed to assume that they are incapable of learning
                      to read and write better than the level they are at right now?</p>
                  <p>This is what we see in news stories, articles, etc.</p>
                  <p>We write so “low” about topics that need more precise language
                      to convey the seriousness or technical expertise of the topic.</p>
                  <p>I urge professors and students to set higher expectations for each other.</p>
                  <p>I encourage them to write at a level
                     slightly above the reading level of the audience they are writing to.</p>
                     <p>Otherwise, we are just contributors towards a continually
                        dropping reading level in our society.</p>

            <h2>Law club travels to Washington D.C.</h2>
            <p> <strong> Date Published:</strong>  March 21, 2022</p>
            <p> <strong> Type: </strong> News</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read Article...</button>
            <div class="content">
               <div class="article">
                  <p>Over the spring break week, the Law Club’s DC
                      committee toured the George Washington University
                      Law School in Washington D.C.</p>
                  <p>The committee started the planning and grant writing process
                      in May of 2021 to submit to SVSU’s Resource Grant Foundation for the trip.</p>
                  <p>On the trip the group toured the National Museum of American History,
                      the National Archives to see the
                     constitution and declaration of independence, the 9/11 pentagon memorial and more.</p>
                  <p>“We packed it tight. We were so exhausted at the end of it but it was good,”
                     professional and technical writing senior Catherine Shuler said.</p>
                  <p>Shuler serves as the Co-Chair of the D.C. Committee Of
                     Law Club along with public administration and Spanish junior Harley Mordarski.</p>
                  <p>Shuler and Mordarski said it was great to get out of the comfort zone of
                     Michigan and tour something new. Many of the
                     students on the trip had hardly ever traveled, especially out of the state.</p>
                  <p>The group was extremely grateful to have SVSU’s
                     support in their club and for their expenses.</p>
                  <p>“To tour a law school out of the state is also incredibly expensive,”
                         Harley said. “Applying to law school in and of itself is incredibly expensive,
                        so providing an opportunity that may not be afforded to every student.”</p>
                  <p>“The planning process was pretty gratifying in and of itself and not
                      just the planning of the proposal, but also getting to receive the grant,”
                      she said. “Finally, and realizing, whoa, we actually have our dream.
                      We can make this happen for students and
                     make this type of a educational experience accessible to students.”</p>
                  <p>Mordarski and Shuler want to see RSO’s grow
                     and take advantage of opportunities for growth.</p>
                  <p>“If an RSO has a good idea, the campus community is usually
                     very generous with advice and guidance,” Mordarski said.
                     “If you aren’t sure where to start, just ask someone.
                     If they don’t have the answers, chances are they know someone who does.”</p>
                  <p>Shuler shared her advice for RSO’s.</p>
                  <p>“My advice to other RSO’s (especially smaller ones that are looking to grow)
                      would be to take advantage of the opportunities provided by SVSU’s Resource
                       Grant Foundation,” Shuler said. “They are pretty open as to what they would
                        be willing to fund. If an RSO needs assistance with purchasing materials
                        or resources for their club’s expansion or promotion, or if they are
                        looking to attend a conference, event, trip, etc. They should consider
                         looking into the opportunities that SVSU’s Resource Grant Foundation
                         provides for students.”</p>
                  <p>Throughout the entire process, Emmie Busch, the manager of the
                      private scholarship and donor stewardship at SVSU met with the
                      D.C. committee throughout the proposalwriting process and was
                      more than willing to help with completing the grant.</p>

            <h2>New movie review: ‘Don’t Look Up’</h2>
            <p> <strong> Date Published:</strong>  Feb 6, 2022</p>
            <p> <strong> Type: </strong>Opinion-Review</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read Article...</button>
            <div class="content">
               <div class="article">
                  <p>The new science fiction movie “Don’t Look Up”
                     by Adam McKay is too soon for its time.</p>
                  <p>The movie starred two astronomers, Leonardo
                     DiCaprio as Dr. Randall Mindy, and Jennifer
                     Lawrence as Kate Dibinsky, who attempted to convince
                     the world of a comet headed straight towards the earth.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Randall and Kate discovered a comet and confirmed
                     that it would collide with earth in roughly six months,
                     causing the entire planet to go extinct on impact.
                     The team had their discovery confirmed by NASA,
                      but when discussing it with the president of the U.S. it did not go over well.</p>
                  <p>After the failed attempt to involve the government,
                     the two took matters into their own hands to share the news with the world.</p>
                  <p>Before watching the movie, I didn’t know much of the content and
                     theme it would be referencing.
                     All I knew was that the movie was science fiction (a type of movie I enjoy.)</p>
                  <p>The movie touched on topics I did not expect,
                     which threw off my expectations of the film.
                     “Don’t Look Up” creates a divisive society:
                     those who believe the scientists and those who do not.</p>
                  <p>This division grows to many extremes as the movie goes on,
                     including big political rallies with the
                      president that resemble those of Donald Trump during his 2020 campaign.</p>
                  <p>The movie shows the division our society saw during the
                     election of 2020, for better or worse. The divisive election
                      having recently occurred and the COVID-19 pandemic continuing
                     that division, the movie made me lose some hope in our society.</p>
                  <p>It brought up emotions that I felt during the last two years
                      during the election and the pandemic where I watched the
                      division in our society grow. If the movie came out later,
                       primarily after the pandemic ended or at least came to more of a close,
                      I believe it would have gone over better.</p>
                  <p>The movie did well its opening weekend on Netflix and has even won
                     some awards, but more time would have allowed it to be received
                     better by its audience. The satire does, however, complete its task;
                     it touches on societal norms and in many ways makes viewers feel uncomfortable.</p>
                  <p>Despite the political vibes of the movie, it does make fun of both sides,
                     which is something I appreciated. The president Janie Orlean,
                      played by Meryl Streep, in many ways resembles Hillary Clinton
                      in the way she makes decisions and dresses but in other ways,
                      she is portrayed more like Donald Trump. There are scenes
                      in the movie of her “rallying” her political allies, wearing a ball cap,
                      and pointing toward people as Trump did.</p>
                  <p>The satire in this movie is strong and even well-executed but
                      I find it needed more time from the events and people it was
                      making fun of before it came out. Despite the way the humor
                      pokes fun at the recent events, the film was scheduled to be
                       recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic began,
                      it was only delayed because of the pandemic.</p>
                  <p>If you look past the surface level humor, there is an
                      underlying tone towards global warming and the way our culture
                      reacts to how things affect our planet (like the comet).</p>
                  <p>But this was lost in translation with
                     the political satire being so charged throughout the piece.</p>
                  <p>With more time, I think the piece’s satire would have
                        been funnier and the focus of global warming and pollution
                        would have been more noticeable,
                        bringing the correct attention to what the movie was attempting to focus on.</p>
                  <p>Either way, I would recommend watching the movie
                     to see the way the satire pokes fun at the way people act nowadays.</p>
