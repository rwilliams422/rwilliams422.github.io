      <h1>Amazon Seller Website Redesign</h1>
      <hr>
      <p> <strong> Date</strong> Fall 2021<p>
      <p> <strong> Project Tools:</strong> Microsoft Word, TechSmith Camtasia, Figma<p>
      <p> <strong> Research Methods: </strong> Task Analysis and Think Aloud Protcol<p>
      <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong>
         Amazon Sellers website consists of poor layout and confusing information for its users.
         Through the Usability Research methods of task analysis
         and think aloud protocol I was able to determine what
         what needed to be the most accessible for the user and
         how the layout needs to align with Norman's Principles of
         design. Proposed changes for the cite are created by app
          prototyping in Figma to meet the needs of the user.
         The proposed changes meet the principles of design,
         visibility, feedback, affordance, mapping, constraints, and consistency.

      <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
      <p> <strong> Object of study</strong> </p>
      <p>Website:  https://sellercentral.amazon.com/ </p>
<p>Note: a login is needed to make and see the page outside of the login page. A Screenshot of object of study are located at the end of the of the memo.</p>
<p> <strong> Summary of website </strong> </p>
<p> This website is for amazon sellers and it documents all the
   information that is needed for an amazon seller. It has
   the listing of items they are trying to sell. There are
   news articles for sellers, helpful tips and even a
   “Seller University” with links and tips on how to sell.
    There is a navbar across the top with Catalog, inventory,
    pricing, orders, advertising, stores, growth, reports,
     performance, partner Network and 2B2. The Navbar is
     partly hidden by the boxes at the top including Total
      Balance, Today’s Sales, Marketplaces etc. </p>
<p> <strong>Audience</strong></p>
<p>The audience of this website is amazon sellers.
   This is not a cite you can see unless you make
   and get approved for an Amazon sellers account.
   The other audience and users of this site would
   be the developers and mainly the IT people dealing
    with Amazon sellers who call in with confusing
    questions. (There are
    a lot of these because of the poor communication
     of information on the cite).</p>
<p> <strong>Editing</strong></p>
I have been using the Amazon Sellers account for the past several months
and the UI is not only poorly looking but it is poorly designed.
Important features like the items you have listed are not easily accessible.
The overall UI is cumbersome and looks like it is simply a rough draft.
The visual cues on the page are confusing, and in some ways not even
there on the page. The header is very small and doesn’t give the
visual cue of “the top”.
These are just some of the issues that need to be addressed in this website.
 Editing this would allow me to conduct Usability Research on what
  the current state of the site and reaching out for comments from friends
  of mine who sell on Amazon sellers.
The end project would include app prototyping that includes a
 better overall UI design which incorporates the UX research that was conducted.
 This mockup wouldn’t have database information from the website,
 but it would have stand in information. Before making that mock-up,
 I would also have simple pdf documents that would design the UI prototype.
Additionally, for text editing, there would be changes made to the “News” Section.
 The information they are trying to convey is important, but it is wordy and
  not explained well. Making these changes would create better communication
   for those using the cite.
<p>
      <h2>UX Research</h2>
      <p>I took two participants one who has never used the website before and
          one who has, to get different feedback in terms of completing tasks that
          amazon sellers need to be able to navigate quickly throughout the process. </p>

      <p>Some tasks I asked them to completes included,</p>
         <p>Can you check your messages?</p>
         <p>See all the past orders that have been shipped in thelast 365 days,</p>
         <p>Add an item to your sellers account</p>
      <p>For the second research method, think aloud protocol I asked them questions in terms of
      Norman's Principles of design</p>
      <p> <strong>Questions </strong> What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of Visibility?
          What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of feedback?
What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of Affordance?
What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of Mapping?
Ask: What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of Constraints?
Ask: What do you see on the Home Screen in terms of Consistency?

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In this project I learned a lot about the design process of editing.
         Content editing for visuals was more overwhelming than I expected it to be.
         Here is on concluding analysis of the new prototype in terms of Norman's Design principles. </p>
      <p><strong>Visibility</strong></p>
      <p>This new UI design creates better visibility for the user.
         While everything was there before like the participants of my study said,
         now the information is more direct, and the extraneous and distracting things
         are no longer there causing blockage. Everything is seen on the screen that
          we need as a user toc complete and get to a task.</p>
       <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
       <p>The website had extremely good feedback when it came to completion of tasks.
           I found that I did not need to make any changes in this area.</p>
      <p><strong>Affordance</strong></p>
          <p>The changes I made on this site create a much better affordance.
             I was able to see how something is used based on what it looks like.
             For example, the help center was just a button before. But now based on what you
              see you have a visual cue that in the help center you will type you questions
               and speak with an agent.
             The same can be said for other elements on the home screen. </p>
       <p><strong>Mapping</strong></p>
          <p>Mapping on this cite is much better now. We can see that on the home
             screen we don’t have a scroll bar because there isn’t a bunch of wasted
              information at the bottom.
             The framework of the space overall is there and is consistent through.  </p>
       <p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>
         <p>During the study, a test user said, “They have a lot of options that feel like
             they all do the same thing.”
               This was something I struggled with a lot as well in the process
               of using this site. With the new layout we have fewer confusing
               constraints. There are less limits for the interactions a user will
                have with the cite.
             </p>
     <p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
        <p>The site had poor consistence before the changes.
           Now we have brighter colors, better font consistence’s and things like the
           navbar running across the entire top of the screen.
           We see the consistency continue we go to the more news section and
           the same navbar across the top
            and the bottom bar are the same as they are on the home screen.  </p>
