         <p class="itemText">I am Professional and Technical Writing major at Saginaw Valley State University.
            I love to write news stories for SVSU’s school paper –
            The Valley Vanguard and develop my skills.</p>
            <p class="itemText">Some of my skills include organization, writing, and time management.
               I enjoy incorporating all of these things into both my professional life and my hobbies.
               In my professional life I have worked at public library, as a development intern and
               two churches. During these three jobs, I have managed events and people, written children’s curriculum, designed
               countless flyers, basic web development, and learned the importance of good directions. </p>
               <p class="itemText">For fun, I enjoy running, playing the piano and learning programming languages.
                  I love finding hobbies that challenge me intellectually and that I can learn from.
                  I also enjoy playing rugby for SVSU's Women's Club Rugby Team.</p>
