      <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong>
         Students in the Professional and Technical Writing program at Saginaw Valley
          State University were entering further into the program lacking information
          they needed to succeed. The
          goal of this project was to create a realistic solution that solved the
          problem which could be implemented into the program. The target audience
         was students who had already started the program but needed pieces of
            information. After completing a focus group and survey to students in
             the program we focused on five areas that students need more information
            including, the labs on campus and what internship is like.
                We created five documents that addressed the issues.
                These documents are now used by professors in the department
                 and the department head for students.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Within our department there is a lack of communication
         to the students about resources and department
         information that ultimately leads to frustration from students
          and lack of involvement.</p>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>At the beginning of the project, we made Personas
         to outline the responses we got from our survey. We
          split the results into two “people” so we could
          visualize the responses based on students who were
           at the end of the program and students who
            were new to the program.
         We took this feedback and used it to shape the
         information we put on the documents.</p>

      <h2>Directed story Telling?</h2>
      <p>During the Project we created scenarios
         for our users to test the documents. The
         goal was to create a real-life scenario
         that students in the program would face.
         Our users navigated through each story and
          used the documents we provided throughout
           the story. After each scenario we asked
           follow up questions and took notes about
            their thoughts.

     <h2>Journey Mapping</h2>
     <p>After our story telling we created a
        journey map for the users that outlines
         their thoughts and . </p>

     <h2>Who are the stakeholders?</h2>

     <p>Midway through the project we looked at who our
        documents would be used by. At the top we have our
         primary audience, students new to the program but
         other people will use the documents. The stakeholder
          map makes sure you verify who your entire audience
           is for your project. Making sure terminology makes
           sense for all these user groups and that the primary
           (top row) and secondary (second top)
        will understand the information in the documents and why its important. </p>

      <h2>Problem Solution</h2>
      <p>In creating the documents, we made sure they addressed
          the problem we identified. Each one addressed the
          communication gaps that we identified in our survey
          and focus group that we did at the beginning of the
          project. We made sure our focus hit those specific
          problems and needs for our students. Now the documents
           are used by professors and staff at Saginaw Valley
            State University to help new students in the
            Professional and Technical Writing Program at SVSU. </p>
